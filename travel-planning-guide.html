<h1>How to Plan an International Trip from India (Step-by-Step Guide)</h1>

<p>
Planning your first international trip can feel overwhelming.
From visa applications to budgeting and currency exchange,
there are many steps involved.
This guide simplifies the entire process.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Choose the Destination</h2>
<p>
Start by deciding your budget, travel duration and season.
Short trips (4–6 days) work well for destinations like Dubai or Maldives,
while Europe requires at least 7–10 days.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Check Visa Requirements</h2>
<p>
Always verify visa requirements from official embassy websites.
Some countries offer visa-on-arrival, while others require prior application.
Apply at least 3–4 weeks before departure.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Estimate Your Budget</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flights</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
<li>Local transport</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>Travel insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>
Always keep an emergency buffer of 10–15%.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Book Flights Smartly</h2>
<p>
Book flights 2–3 months in advance.
Compare prices on multiple platforms.
Mid-week flights are often cheaper.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Accommodation Planning</h2>
<p>
Choose hotels near city centers or metro stations.
Read recent reviews carefully before booking.
</p>

<h2>Step 6: Travel Insurance</h2>
<p>
Travel insurance is highly recommended.
It protects against medical emergencies and trip cancellations.
</p>

<h2>Step 7: Currency & SIM Card</h2>
<p>
Exchange small amount of currency before departure.
International SIM or eSIM helps with maps and bookings.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Booking visa appointment too late</li>
<li>Not checking baggage rules</li>
<li>Overpacking</li>
<li>Ignoring local transport passes</li>
</ul>
